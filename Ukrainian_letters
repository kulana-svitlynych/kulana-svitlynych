The whisper of paper pages is my first conscious sound memory. It still brings trembling worshiping feelings towards the printed text. The past year proved one more time how language and printed text define the nation and the mentality.

 

I am in love with every letter of my native language alphabet, every squiggle. Being underwater, upside down, or in zero gravity, I will recognize "ґ", "є", "і", "ї". These 4 unique Ukrainian letters set my soul at peace as if mother rests her hands on my shoulders.

 

May these letters remind you of home and warm memories of the first books read in childhood. Notice, celebrate them, and let them guide you as 4 lighthouses of the Ukrainian language.
